#' @title estimate remaining life expectancy in the open age group
#' @description This calculation is based on an indirect method to reference the Coale-Demeny West model lifetable. First one makes a psuedo lifetable deaths column using some stable pop assumptions (different in seg vs ggbseg). Then take the ratio of the sum of ages 10-39 to 40-59. These ratios have been worked out for each model lifetable level, so we can pick the level based on the ratio we produce from the data. From there, we just pick out the remaining life expectancy that corresponds to the top age in our data, which for now hopefully isn't higher than 95. The model lifetables don't go higher than 95 for now, but that's well beyond the range for this method family. If your data go beyong 85 or so, then just group down to 85, say, and estimate using that instead of keeping a high open age. Called by \code{segMakeColumns()} and \code{ggbsegMakeColumns()}, and not intended for direct user interface, because you need to produce the \code{$deathsLT} column. You can skip calling this function by specifying \code{eOpen} in the top call to \code{seg()} or \code{ggbseg()}.

#' @title estimate death registration coverage for a single year/sex/region using the Bennet-Horiuchi method
#' 
#' @description Given two censuses and an average annual number of deaths in each age class between censuses, we can use stable population assumptions to estimate the degree of underregistration of deaths. The method estimates age-specific degrees of coverage. The age pattern of these is assumed to be noisy, so we take the arithmetic mean over some range of ages. One may either specify a particular age-range, or let the age range be determined automatically. If the age-range is found automatically, this is done using the method developed for the generalized growth-balance method. Part of this method relies on a prior value for remaining life expectancy in the open age group. By default, this is estimated using a standard reference to the Coale-Demeny West model lifetable, although the user may also supply a value. Called by \code{seg()}. Users probably do not need to use this function directly.

If only \code{year1} and \code{year2} are given, then we assume January 1 dates. If year and month are given, then we assume dates on the first of the month.

If you want coverage estimates for a variety of intercensal periods/regions/by sex, then stack them, and use a variable called \code{$cod} with a unique values for each data chunk. Different values of \code{$cod} could indicate sexes, regions, intercensal periods, etc. The \code{$deaths} column should refer to the average annual deaths in each age class in the intercensal period. Sometimes one uses the arithmetic average of recorded deaths in each age, or simply the average of the deaths around the time of census 1 and census 2. To identify an age-range in the traditional visual way, see \code{plot.ggb()}, when working with a single year/sex/region of data. The automatic age-range determination feature of this function tries to implement an intuitive way of picking ages that follows the advice typically given for doing so visually. We minimize the square of the average squared residual between the fitted line and right term. Finally, only specify \code{eOpen} when working with a single region/sex/period of data, otherwise the same value will be passed in irrespective of mortality and sex.

#' @title estimate death registration coverage for a single year/sex/region using the modified Bennet-Horiuchi method
#' 
#' @description Given two censuses and an average annual number of deaths in each age class between censuses, we can use stable population assumptions to estimate the degree of underregistration of deaths. The method estimates age-specific degrees of coverage. The age pattern of these is assumed to be noisy, so we take the arithmetic mean over some range of ages. One may either specify a particular age-range, or let the age range be determined automatically. If the age-range is found automatically, this is done using the method developed for the generalized growth-balance method. Part of this method relies on a prior value for remaining life expectancy in the open age group. By default, this is estimated using a standard reference to the Coale-Demeny West model lifetable, although the user may also supply a value. The difference between this method and \code{seg()} is that here we adjust census 1 part way through processing, based on some calcs similar to GGB. Called by \code{ggbseg()}. Users probably do not need to use this function directly.
#' 
#' @details Census dates can be given in a variety of ways: 1) using Date classes, and column names \code{$date1} and \code{$date2} (or an unambiguous character string of the date, like, \code{"1981-05-13"}) or 2) by giving column names \code{"day1","month1","year1","day2","month2","year2"} containing integers. If only \code{year1} and \code{year2} are given, then we assume January 1 dates. If year and month are given, then we assume dates on the first of the month.

#' @param exact.ages optional. use an exact set of ages to estimate coverage.
#' @param minA the minimum of the age range searched. Default 15
#' @param maxA the maximum of the age range searched. Default 75

If only \code{year1} and \code{year2} columns are given, then we assume January 1 dates. If year and month are given, then we assume dates on the first of the month. If you want coverage estimates for a variety of intercensal periods/regions/by sex, then stack them, and use a variable called \code{$cod} with a unique values for each data chunk. Different values of \code{$cod} could indicate sexes, regions, intercensal periods, etc. The \code{$deaths} column should refer to the average annual deaths in each age class in the intercensal period. Sometimes one uses the arithmetic average of recorded deaths in each age, or simply the average of the deaths around the time of census 1 and census 2. To identify an age-range in the traditional visual way, see \code{plot.ggb()}, when working with a single year/sex/region of data. The automatic age-range determination feature of this function tries to implement an intuitive way of picking ages that follows the advice typically given for doing so visually. We minimize the square of the average squared residual between the fitted line and right term. Finally, only specify \code{eOpen} when working with a single region/sex/period of data, otherwise the same value will be passed in irrespective of mortality and sex.
