\title{make the growth-adjusted quasi lifetable columns required by GGB method}
\usage{
ggbFittedFromAges(codi, agesfit, deaths.summed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{codi}{a chunk of data (single sex, year, region, etc) with all columns required by \code{ggb()}}

\item{agesfit}{an a priori set of ages for which to calculate the fit}

\item{deaths.summed}{logical. is the deaths column given as the total per age in the intercensal period (\code{TRUE}). By default we assume \code{FALSE}, i.e. that the average annual was given.}
}
\value{
codi, with many columns added, most importantly \code{$rightterm}, \code{$leftterm}, and \code{$exclude}.
}
\description{
Called by \code{ggbChooseAges()} and \code{ggbcoverageFromYear()}. This simply modulates some code that would otherwise be repeated. Users probably don't need to call this function directly. If columns produced by \code{ggbMakeColumns()} are not present, then we call it here just to keep things from breaking.
